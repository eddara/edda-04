        "My name is Edda Rabold, and I'm a industrial designer located in Marseille who specializes in digital fabrication technologies and unique design processes. I graduated from Burg Giebichenstein in Halle (Germany) with a degree in Industrial Design and studied at the Art and Design Academy Bezalel in Jerusalem (Israel).",
        "Matter in all its forms, whether digital or analog, is my creative source. I study ecological, cultural, postnatural issues related to matter. Matter is an essential element of my work, motivated by my desire to interact physically with the materials I work with and encourage others to do the same. This has to do with investigating robotic systems and digital fabrication techniques. I work with existing processes and investigate them from a fresh, curious, and innocent standpoint. My method relies heavily on interaction and co-fabrication, and I'm interested in delving deeper into these ideas in installations and artist collaborations. I view my work as an ongoing conversation between digital and artisanal creation, a kind of research, where the outcome can be a product, a method or installation.",
