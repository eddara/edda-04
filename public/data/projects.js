With the use of recycled Aluminium and a melting kiln, I experiment with my own modulat casting techniques: partial casting, additive casting and casting to assembly. The approach highlights the traces of the process, the imprints left by the liquid metal, highlighting the contrasts between artisanal and industrial pieces. The exhibition shows a stool, a table and a chandelier, each bearing witness to this hybrid exploration of recycling, craft and cast aluminium",

For this purpose, shapes are generated from data of the artificial voice. These shapes serve as a new interface of interaction, thus as a speaker. Speech dialog systems take a place in our social environment through the possibility of verbal interaction.
